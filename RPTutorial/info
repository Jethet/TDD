The directory ds stores the datastructure. The __init__.py creates a package
inside the ds directory. In the stack.py the datastructure is implemented.

The directory tests stores the tests.

Using pytest, any file used for testing needs to have the prefix test_<name>.
The name of a function to be tested needs to start with test_ as well.

The tutorial DOES NOT MENTION the pytest.ini file that you should have in the
root directory. Not exactly sure which is the root directory here (is it GitHub,
is it TDD, is it RPTutorial?). I have chosen to create pytest.ini in the TDD
directory and the pytest now works.

Why are all of these tutorials missing information? For example, do not install
with pip but with pip3. Do not use python -m pytest -v but python3 -m pytest -v.
The fact that VERSION 3 has to be added is not mentioned and at the same time
this creates all sorts of errors. These simple things (for experienced
developers, that is) are left out and that is costing me hours to track down
why I get error messages.
