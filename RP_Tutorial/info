The directory ds stores the datastructure. The __init__.py creates a package
inside the ds directory. In the stack.py the datastructure is implemented.

The directory tests stores the tests.

Using pytest, any file used for testing needs to have the prefix test_<name>.
The name of a function to be tested needs to start with test_ as well.
